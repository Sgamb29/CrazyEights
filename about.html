        <p class="description">
         <strong>The goal of the game is to be the first player with 0 cards.</strong><br><br>
         The current main card is in the center of the table and on your turn you can either play
         a card of the same suit or the same number as the main card.<br><br> If you cannot play then you draw a card from the 
         deck that is beside the main card.<br><br>
         <strong>Special Cards:</strong><br><br>
         <strong>2's:</strong> Makes the other person pick up 2 cards. If the other player puts a 2 on top of your two than you have to pick up two cards times how many two's are there (2, 4, 6, 8).
         <br>
         <strong>Jacks:</strong> Makes the other player skip their turn.
         <br>
         <strong>Eights:</strong> A wild card, you can play it anytime and change the suit to whatever you like.
